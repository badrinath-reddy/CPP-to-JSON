# Status

> Except for some attributes like stateMutability, Everything mentioned in the sample output and also some more information extracted. **completed**

# Files

- `main.py`: The main File

# Execution Instructions:

> Just write whichever code you want to parse in a file and pass that file as input to `main.py` and execute it will print the output in the console.

# Command:

```console
foo@bar:~$ python3 main.py <file_name>
```

# Work Distribution:

#### Badrinath:

> Handled the following things and dealt with the linking of Functions, Blocks, Statements, Member Functions etc. in Respective Positions

- **Function Names**
- **Function Parameters** (_including array types, pointer types and complex type such as long long_)
- **Return Parameters** (_including pointer types and complex type such as long long_)
- **Function Definitions**
- **Class Definitions**
- **Member Function Declarations**
- **Member Function Definitions**
- **If-Else Blocks** (_also handled nested if-else ladders_)
- **While, For and Do-While Iterative Blocks** (_also handled nested iterative blocks_)
- **Jump Statements** (_break, continue and return_)
- **All expression types are handled** (_including conditional and excluding very few rare expression types_)
- **Using Directives**
- **Access Specifiers** (_public, private, protected_)

#### Dhanvanth:

> Handled information with respect to variables(simple variables, arrays, pointers, pointer arrays, pointer variables,initialized (variables, arrays).. etc)

- **Non Pointer Uninitialized Variables**(_i.e only declarations_)
- **Non Pointer Simple Variables**
- **Non Pointer Array Variables**
- **Pointer Uninitialized Variables**(_i.e only declarations_)
- **Pointer Simple Variables**
- **Pointer Array Variables**
- **Non Pointer Initialized Variables**(_which includes simple and array types and initialized with expressions_)
- **Pointer Initialized Variables**(_which includes simple and array types and initialized with expressions_)
- **Initialized Variables outside class and outside Functions**(_like global variables initializations and declarations_)
